    openglwindow is a program that displays a group
    of different kinds of windows with sound using OpenGL.
    Initially there is a selection screen to select 
    the type of window to display.  Each display 
    has a number of keys enabled.
    The keys are as follows.
    a right
    s back
    d left
    w forward
    r up
    f down
    x reverse view.
    z reset view.
    Escape ends the program.
    Alt+Return sets full screen.
    Up arrow zooms in.
    Down arrow zooms out.
    
    To compile the program you will need the following libraries:
    FreeImage, GLEW, boost, pthread, Assimp, GLM, Xlib, SFML, and 
    the window libaries, SDL2, freeglut, ClanLib-4.0, Allegro5, SFML,
    and GLFW3. You must also have cmake and doxygen.
    The commands are:
    
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    sudo make doc
    sudo make install
    
    To run a program use:
    
    openglwindow
    
    To run one individually use:
    
    openglallegro
    openglsdl2
    openglglut
    openglglfw3
    openglcl40
    openglsfml
    
    The documentation is located in:
    
    /usr/share/doc/openglwindow-doc
    
    The assimpopengl subdirectory can be made into a separate program and 
    used to provide Assimp library support for any project you may
    care to undertake.  Just copy the assimpopengl directory:
    
    cp -r openglwindow/datagen/assimpopengl yourlocation
    
    and use it as you wish.

    OpenGL is generally available on any system as part 
    of the underlying graphics subsystem and GLEW will 
    get you access to it.
    
    The program was written and compiled on debian linux available at:  www.debian.org.
